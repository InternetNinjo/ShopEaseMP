## üìñ Overview

- We plan to build an online store using Microsoft Azure. We want it to handle a lot of customers and work reliably. To do this, we'll use Azure services like Virtual Networks, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Application Gateway.

- This setup will give us a strong, secure, and cost-effective online shopping solution that can grow as needed.

## üìù Azure Services Utilized

* **Azure Virtual Networks (AVN):** Provides a secure and isolated network environment for resources, enabling secure communication and segmentation.
* **Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS):** Ensures automatic scaling of virtual machine instances based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and providing high availability.
* **Azure Application Gateway:** A Layer 7 load balancer that provides application-level routing, SSL termination, and a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for enhanced security and performance.
